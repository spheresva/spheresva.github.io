<h1>Welcome to NTAG 213!</h1>
<p>NTAG 213 was made in 2013, by NXP semiconductors.</p>
<p>It was the first of a line-up of 3 circular NFC tags, made for various wireless applications.</p>
<p>NTAG 213 features 180 bytes of raw data capacity, 144 bytes of manipulatable data, 132 character URLs, 130 character text notes, and 4 V-Card fields</p>
<p>It's the earliest, cheapest, and least expansive of its lineup, but is still useful for things such as wireless business cards, and labels.</p>
